1.  we represent the cube  folding as a kind of graph. 
    each square is a struct with 4 pointers to four 
    other squares. If square A is connected say on the 
    bottom with square B, then A->bottom = B. If 
    square A has a slit at the bototm, let 
    A->bottom = null or something like that. 

    how would we quickly and efficiently see if it folds
    into a unit cube?

        we could first check if it has at least 6 
        connected squares using dfs. 

        then we could set one square as the base. the bottom
        square, then fold it around and see if it turns into
        a cube with all 6 sides with another sort of struct
        keeping track of all the sides of the cube.
